\title{
Performs balance checking after multilevel matching.
}
\description{
This function checks balance after multilevel balance. It checks balance on both level-one (student) and level-two (school) covariates.
It reports results from both the t-test and nonparametric tests including Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon signed rank test.
}
\usage{
balanceMulti(match.obj, student.cov = NULL, school.cov = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{match.obj}{
A multilevel match object
}
  \item{student.cov}{
Names of student level covariates that you want to check balance
}
  \item{school.cov}{
Names of school level covariates for which you want to check balance, if any.
}
}
\details{
This function returns a list which include balance checks for before and after matching for both level-one and level-two covariates.
Balance statistics include treated and control means, standardized differences, which is the difference in means divided by
the pooled standard deviation before matching, and p-values from parametric and nonparametric tests.
